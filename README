This is the Perl distribution Text-Pipe. It provides a common text filter API.

## Installation

Text-Pipe installation is straightforward. If your CPAN shell is
set up, you should just be able to do

    % cpan Text::Pipe

Download it, unpack it, then build it as per the usual:

    % perl Makefile.PL
    % make && make test

Then install it:

    % make install

## Documentation

Text-Pipe documentation is available as in POD. So you can do:

    % perldoc Text::Pipe

to read the documentation online with your favorite pager.

If you are looking for the Windows software 'TextPipe Pro', go to
http://www.datamystic.com/ - this Perl module has nothing to do with it.
